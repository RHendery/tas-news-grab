Currently you have to manually add the search string and it writes results to a file and appends it after each search

What still needs to be done, I will be able to work on this again from then 10th of July
1. Put in a loop to read each search string form a text file, then the whole process is automated and you basically receive everything within a few seconds
2. I tested with pdfkit to make pdf of the resulting urls, this could be an alternative to scraping. The code works but it takes a lot of time to then run a singe search if it writes out pdf during the search. What would be better is once the full list is available have a separate process to generate pdfs from the provided links. This could partly address the problem with the posting that does not follow the same structure.
3. What would be useful if there as specific terms coming up with the job posting we that could be added to the search strings.
4. I have not cleaned up the list yet, there may be duplicates.

An alternative would be to use the generated list directly in a webscraping script as well.

Any suggestion welcome, I hope this could help in some form.
